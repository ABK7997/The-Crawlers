# The-Crawlers
My first attempt at something akin to a tactical RPG rouge-like. Yeah, it's strange. The game is tile-based and heavily click-oriented. Six specialized characters make their way through a series of somewhat randomly-generated dungeon. Only finished the first 3 stages though with the first 3 characters.
